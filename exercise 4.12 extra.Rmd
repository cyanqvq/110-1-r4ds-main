  * The first row is actually feature names.

Some functions in R can **get** you values AND be used to **set** values at the same time. For this type of functions, its **Usage** is usually written as

```
fun(input1)
fun(input1) <- 
```

```{r}
?names
?levels
```

  * `fun(input1) <- ` allows you to **set** the value returned by `fun(input1)`. 
  
  * `fun(input1) <- RHS` must habe `RHS` the same structure as `fun(input1)` return.
  
```{r}
names(drug$data) # the structure is a character vecotr of 10
newNames <- drug$data[1, ]
newNames |> class()
newNames |>
  as.character() -> names(drug$data)
```

```{r}
drug$data2 <- drug$data[-1, ]
# 1
pick12_1 <- drug$data2$毒品品項 == '安非他命'
sum(pick12_1, na.rm = T)

# 2
pick12_2 <- drug$data2$毒品品項 %in% drugSet
sum(pick12_2, na.rm = T)
```
